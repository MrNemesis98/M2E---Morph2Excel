Morph2Excel (M2E) is a console-based application that provides multiple operations on the so-called wikimorph database, 
an A.I. generated JSON file that contains morphological and etymological information about several English terms. 
The M2E software is able to search for specific entries within this database and create a special formatted excel file as output. 
Since this software was created for linguistic research in the field of anglistics, the user can choose between several output formats 
and search restrictions within the program settings. M2E was developed to cover a wide range of research goals and needs.

The project Morph2Excel was financed by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft / DFG). It was developed and tested as part of the ERSaF (English Root Stress across Frameworks) project at Trier University, Germany.
